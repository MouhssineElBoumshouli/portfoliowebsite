## Overview

The Key Points Detection System is a sophisticated computer vision project that combines the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm with OpenCV to identify and analyze significant points in images. This implementation provides a robust solution for various computer vision applications, from object recognition to shape analysis.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Point Detection**: Dynamically adjusts detection sensitivity based on input parameters
- **Multi-contour Processing**: Handles multiple objects and complex shapes within single images
- **Visualization Tools**: Real-time visualization of detected points overlaid on original images
- **Configurable Parameters**: Flexible epsilon value adjustment for varying levels of detail
- **Coordinate Extraction**: Precise extraction and reporting of key point coordinates

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **OpenCV**: Core computer vision operations and image processing
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization and result presentation
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations and array operations

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was optimizing the epsilon value calculation to achieve the right balance between accuracy and performance. This required developing a deep understanding of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm and its interaction with OpenCV's contour detection system. The project also demanded careful consideration of edge cases in image processing.

## Outcome

The implementation successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of combining modern computer vision techniques with classical algorithms. The system provides accurate and reliable key point detection, making it valuable for applications in object recognition, shape analysis, and image matching. The project showcases advanced image processing capabilities while maintaining code modularity and reusability.
