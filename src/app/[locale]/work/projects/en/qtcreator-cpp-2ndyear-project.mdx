## Overview

The Modern Finance Tracker is a desktop application developed to simplify personal finance management. Built using C++ and Qt, this project combines robust backend functionality with an intuitive user interface. The application helps users track their income and expenses, visualize financial data through interactive charts, and maintain a comprehensive overview of their financial health.

## Key Features

- **Transaction Management**: Seamless addition and organization of income and expenses with category-based classification
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time display of current balance, recent transactions, and financial summaries
- **Data Visualization**: Dynamic charts and graphs showing spending patterns and financial trends
- **Theme Customization**: Built-in light and dark theme support for better user experience
- **Data Export**: Flexible export options including CSV and PDF formats
- **SQLite Integration**: Reliable local data storage ensuring data persistence and quick access

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core programming language for application logic
- **Qt Framework**: For creating the responsive user interface
- **SQLite**: Local database management
- **CMake**: Build system configuration and management
- **QtCharts**: For implementing financial data visualization

## Challenges and Learnings

A significant challenge was implementing a robust database structure that could efficiently handle various transaction types while maintaining data integrity. The project required careful consideration of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to ensure clean separation of concerns. Additionally, optimizing the charting system for larger datasets required implementing efficient data processing algorithms.

## Outcome

The Modern Finance Tracker successfully demonstrates the power of combining C++ with modern UI frameworks. The application achieves its goal of simplifying personal finance management while providing valuable insights through data visualization. The project showcases effective use of software design patterns, database integration, and user interface design principles.
